# Serverless REST API with DynamoDB and API Gateway

##  Solution Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a **serverless REST API** on AWS to manage a simple to-do list (or customer records). The backend is fully serverless, relying on **Amazon API Gateway**, **AWS Lambda**, and **Amazon DynamoDB** for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

A static frontend hosted on **Amazon S3** (and optionally distributed via **Amazon CloudFront**) communicates with the backend via RESTful endpoints.

The solution is **cost-effective, scalable, and fully managed** â€” meaning developers do not have to manage servers or infrastructure.

###  Key Highlights:
- **Amazon API Gateway** provides REST endpoints for client interaction.  
- **AWS Lambda** functions handle CRUD logic and are triggered by API Gateway.  
- **Amazon DynamoDB** stores persistent records (NoSQL).  
- **AWS IAM** enforces secure access through roles and policies.  
- **Amazon CloudWatch** monitors logs, errors, and performance metrics.  
- **Amazon S3** hosts the static frontend.

The following diagram illustrates the architecture of the solution:

###  Workflow:
1. The **user** interacts with the **frontend** hosted on Amazon S3.  
2. The frontend sends **HTTP requests** to **Amazon API Gateway**.  
3. API Gateway routes the request to the **Lambda function**.  
4. Lambda executes the appropriate CRUD logic and interacts with **DynamoDB** for data persistence.  
5. Logs and monitoring are collected in **Amazon CloudWatch**.  
6. **IAM roles and policies** control access between services securely.  


# Customizing the Solution

## Prerequisites for Customization

- AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)  
- Node.js 20.x or later

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-project.git
cd my-project
export MAIN_DIRECTORY=$PWD

```


### 2. Unit Test

After making changes, run unit tests to make sure added customizations pass:

```bash
cd $MAIN_DIRECTORY/deployment
chmod +x run-unit-tests.sh && ./run-unit-tests.sh

```

### 3. Build and Deploy
```bash
cd $MAIN_DIRECTORY/source/constructs
npm run clean:install
overrideWarningsEnabled=false npx cdk bootstrap --profile <PROFILE_NAME>
overrideWarningsEnabled=false npx cdk deploy \
 --parameters DeployDemoUIParameter=Yes \
 --parameters SourceBucketsParameter=<MY_BUCKET> \
 --profile <PROFILE_NAME>

```

_Note:_
- **MY_BUCKET**: name of an existing bucket or the list of comma-separated bucket names in your account
- **PROFILE_NAME**: name of an AWS CLI profile that has appropriate credentials for deploying in your preferred region
